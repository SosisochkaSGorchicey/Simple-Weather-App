# Simple-Weather-App
This is a simple application showing the weather forecast.  
It uses libraries such as Jetpack Compose, Retrofit, OkHttp, Room, and so on.  
The data is obtained using weatherapi.com  

In the future, I would like to improve the app by adding the ability to save multiple cities and geo-location tracking!
